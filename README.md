# Java Socket Programming â€“ Client-Server Architecture

This repository demonstrates two implementations of a TCP-based client-server model using Java:

- **Single-threaded server:** Handles one client connection at a time
- **Multithreaded server:** Handles multiple client connections concurrently using threads

Both implementations use Java's core networking libraries (`Socket`, `ServerSocket`) and I/O streams to exchange messages between client and server applications.
