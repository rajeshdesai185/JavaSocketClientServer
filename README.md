# Java Socket Programming – Single-threaded & Multithreaded Client-Server

This repository contains two Java projects demonstrating TCP socket communication using a **client-server architecture**:

- 🔹 `single_threaded/`: A basic server that handles **one client at a time**
- 🔹 `multithreaded/`: A more advanced server that handles **multiple clients concurrently** using Java threads

These examples showcase how Java networking works using `ServerSocket`, `Socket`, `BufferedReader`, and `PrintWriter`.
